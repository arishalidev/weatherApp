Get a weather forecast anywhere so you can be prepared!
This app works by sending user input to a geocode api (nominatim.openstreetmap.og), and gets a pair of coordinates.
It then uses the coordinates to get weather data using another api(api.weather.gov).
Finally the app neatly displays the data, with an hourly or daily forecast.
